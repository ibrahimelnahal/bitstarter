<h1>To Whom It May Concern;</h1>
        <h1> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of Mr. Ibrahim Elnahal. As an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Sciences and Engineering at Istanbul Şehir University, I instructed Mr. Ibrahim in several classes. He proved to be a capable and motivated student with all of the qualities necessary to pursue further studies in a master’s program.</h1>

<h1>I instructed Mr. Ibrahim in Computer Networks and his graduation project. Mr. Elnahal displayed impressive analytical skills and a keen intellect. His work in class was consistently completed on time, and he participated in class with valuable contributions. I taught him about using the Internet as a vehicle; this course introduces the underlying concepts and principles of modern computer networks with emphasis on protocols, architectures, and implementation issues. Mr. Elnahal is able to explore layering in computer networks and understand different protocol stacks (OSI and TCP/IP). He is also being trained on functions and protocols within a layer, understand how layers fit together and finally understand how the Internet works. He displayed a rigorous intellect during his undergraduate studies, and I can thus confidently recommend him for entrance to your master’s program, as I feel that he will continue to perform at this high level.</h1>
 
<h1>For his graduation project, he is using SPSS program to collect data by conducting survey at school. He is restructuring the data he is collecting to make it fit for the type of analysis he is doing. In this regard, he will use the statistical software SPSS and use it by writing inquiries (which is like writing computer programming codes). He is then applying certain statistical methods and writing up his findings. In so doing, The final goal for Ibrahim is to get this paper published in a national or international peer reviewed journal.</h1>

<h1>As Mr. Elnahal hopes to pursue a master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I feel that his undergraduate experience will aid him greatly in this goal. He proved adept and ambitious in our department, and I expect him to continue to excel in your institution.</h1>

<h1>In brief, Mr. Elnahal is a highly motivated student with an intellect and a background that have prepared him well for the challenges of pursuing a master’s degree in your institution. I see no reason that he will be anything other than an excellent addition to your school, and I therefore recommend him without reservation.</h1>
